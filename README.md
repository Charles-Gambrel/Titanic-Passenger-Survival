# Titanic-Passenger-Survival

## Although not exactly a documentary, the blockbuster hit, _Titanic_, does offer some historic accuracies. An especially perceptive viewer might notice some patterns that determine if a passenger survived the accident. For example, the irish passengers in third class were well below the deck and so were at risk of drowning immediatly. Women and children were rushed to life boats and the old saying states that a captian must go down with the ship. This begs the question if analysis can be done to predict which passengers survived the accident. 

## In this notebook I analize a dataset of Titanic passenger information and train machine learning algorithms to achieve a 77% accuracy in survial prediction.
